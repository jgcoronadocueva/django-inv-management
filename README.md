# Overview

This Inventory Management System web application, built with Django, serves as a practical exercise in full-stack development. The project focuses on designing data models, managing relational data, implementing reusable service layers, and creating dynamic templates. Through this application, my goal was to learn how to use Django framework  to improve my skills in web development and Python programming while applying clean code principles such as clear separation of models, services, views, and routing. This tool efficiently manages products, suppliers, and inventory levels, combining functionality with maintainable code structure.

To start the test server on your computer:

- Clone the repository and navigate to the program root folder.
- Ensure dependencies are installed: pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run the Django development server: python manage.py runserver
- Open a web browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
